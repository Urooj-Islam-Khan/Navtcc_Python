# Exercise 1: Variable Declaration
# Declare three variables: one integer, one float, and one string. Assign any values of your choice to these variables and find their types.

a=1
b=1.2
c="hello"
print(type(a),type(b),type(c))
# Exercise 2: Variable Swapping
# Swap the values of two variables without using a third variable.

a= 5
b=4
print("Brfore Swap")
print("a= ",a,"b= ",b)
a,b =b,a

print("After Swap")
print("a= ",a,"b= ",b)

# Exercise 3: Data Type Conversion
# Convert the following:

# Convert an integer to a float.
a= 5
a2 = float(a)
print(a2)
# Convert a float to an integer.
b=2.3
b2 = int(b)
print(b2)
# Convert an integer to a string.
c=98
c2 = str(c)
print(c2)

# Exercise 4: String Concatenation
# Create two strings and concatenate them together using the + operator.
name + "Urooj"
fname = "Islam"
print(name + fname)

# Exercise 5:
# Create a Python program to find the lengths of 2 strings as a input from the user, then concatenate those lengths.
n1 = input("Enter a string1: ")
n2 = input("Enter a string2: ")

# Exercise 6:
# Create a  Python program to demonstrate different data types (int, float, string) and display their types.


# Exercise 7:
# Create a Python program to create a sequence of data types and take input from the user for each data type.
# Then, display below the user's input to show which data type it belongs to.print("a= ",a,"b= ",b)
